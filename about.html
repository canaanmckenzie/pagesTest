  			<p>I'm Canaan. I've created this site as a place to store my projects and some thoughts about my journey into software development. I studied Mechanical Engineering at the University of Vermont. Recently I did a brief three year stint working as a scientist for large biotech startup. After realizing that space wasn't for me, at least not in the capacity I was doing it, I decided I was going to fulfill my passion for working and living online, we will see where it goes. My interests right now are cryptocurrency, brutalist web design, astronomy, and robotics...but specifically the soft squishy kind.</p>
